Hello there, just an app to show how real apps should look like

so we used MVP Structure and scheme to create this app with the best performance

1- MVP:

MVP Swift Featured snippet from the web MVP stands for Model View Presenter and is, at its core, an effective way to move much of the logic from your ViewController files and instead replace it with a call to a presenter. This means everything on your Presenter file is testable and easy to access and read.

Scheme:

The beginning of any new or existing iOS application development cycle should start off on the right foot. A solid foundation to support each environment level within the configuration of the XCode project is a great first step to the success of your application.
